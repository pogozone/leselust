Step one
In preparation, all the necessary components must first be compiled:
The design team must provide the design and colour tokens for the brand identity.
The product team must provide information on all links - primary, secondary, identity, journey links.

Step two
Prepare the configuration files in tenant config:
- Create config for OneNav: [brand]/channels/navigation/_one-nav.ts
- Create config for TriggerableContainer: [brand]/channels/navigation/_one-nav-triggerable-containers.ts
- Import both to [brand]/channels/_default.ts

Step three
Prepare OneNav in _default.ts
Write the configuration itself

Step four
Rollout: multiverso - staging - production

Step five
Step six
Step seven





OneNav

OneNav is hierachical organised in Areas, Rows and Clickables as well as TriggerableContainers.

Rows

Rows represent a horizontal space that can contain one or more areas. The areas can be right-aligned, left-aligned or centred.

Areas

Areas are spaces that can contain one or more clickables. The clickables can be aligned to the right, left or centred in the area.

Clickables

Clickables are elements that can be clicked and trigger an action:
- Call up a URL
- Open or close a TriggerableContainer
- Open or close an accordion
A clickable can contain a text, an icon, an image (logo) and an action (link, OnClick event).
OneNav provides several types of Clickables:
TextClickable, LogoClickable, JourneyUnits, Accordion, OneNavStickyHeroAd and IdentityUnits


TriggerableContainers

A TriggerableContainer is a container element that can contain and wrap any child elements such as:
- another OneNav
- third party elements like login, logout or register links
It can be enabled and disabled by relating links, eg a burger button.
