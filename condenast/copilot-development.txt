Start CoPilot Local

1. aws

When it's the first time to start aws authentication you have to configure it:

aws configure sso

SSO session name: aws-us

Answer all following questions with just enter.

Check if this two aws accounts are listed (if not... -> ServiceNow):
- gp-nonprod
- eks-tenant-copilot-ro

Later use this to authenticate:
aws sso login --sso-session aws-us

If that does not work proper try this:
npm run aws:login

2. prepare environment

Add CoPilot URL to /etc/hosts file:

127.0.0.1 copilot-local.condenast.io
::1 copilot-local.condenast.io

3. prepare CoPilot

Requirements:

node v16.13.0
npm v8.6.0

nvm install 16.13.0
npm install npm@8.6.0 -g

nvm install
npm login
npm install --prefer-online
cp .env.example .env

Edit .env and change line 64 to:
APOLLO_SCHEMA_REPORTING=false

4. start CoPilot

nvm use && npm ci && npm run start

Call a brands dashboard. eg.:
http://copilot-local.condenast.io:1234/bon
...as the overall start page does not work.

===================================================================
1. create a prerelease

Publishing a Prerelease Version
-> https://github.com/CondeNast/copilot-core-monorepo/blob/main/README.md
-> add the prerelease version to copilot/package.json
-> at copilot: npm install
-> add package.json AND package-lock.json to feature branch
===================================================================

2. merge feature branch of copilot-core-monorepo to main

to get a copilot-core-monorepo feature branch merged to main you should do following:

as I have seen I am able to merge by myself ignore the next linses and jump directly to the copilot part.

git fetch && git merge main
git push

then post the PR to #copilot-devs channel like this:
"I would be very grateful if someone could MERGE this PR:"
-> MERGE should be bold... cause otherwhise you'll get just an approval but no merge.
===================================================================

3. add the new release to copilot

-> add the release version to copilot/package.json
-> create a PR

because of npmjs search does not work just add the package to the url manually.
for instance:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@condenast/copilot-brand-overrides
===================================================================

4. release copilot

after merging have a look at https://copilot-release.condenast.io/
-> it might last about 10 to 20 minutes until the PR is visible here
-> go to https://departures.conde.io/takeoff/copilot and click "Approve"

check the status of build here:
