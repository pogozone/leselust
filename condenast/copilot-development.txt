1. create a prerelease

Publishing a Prerelease Version
-> https://github.com/CondeNast/copilot-core-monorepo/blob/main/README.md
-> add the prerelease version to copilot/package.json
-> at copilot: npm install
-> add package.json AND package-lock.json to feature branch
===================================================================

2. merge feature branch of copilot-core-monorepo to main

to get a copilot-core-monorepo feature branch merged to main you should do following:

as I have seen I am able to merge by myself ignore the next linses and jump directly to the copilot part.

git fetch && git merge main
git push

then post the PR to #copilot-devs channel like this:
"I would be very grateful if someone could MERGE this PR:"
-> MERGE should be bold... cause otherwhise you'll get just an approval but no merge.
===================================================================

3. add the new release to copilot

-> add the release version to copilot/package.json
-> create a PR

because of npmjs search does not work just add the package to the url manually.
for instance:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@condenast/copilot-brand-overrides
===================================================================

4. release copilot

after merging have a look at https://copilot-release.condenast.io/
-> it might last about 10 to 20 minutes until the PR is visible here
-> go to https://departures.conde.io/takeoff/copilot and click "Approve"

check the status of build here:
