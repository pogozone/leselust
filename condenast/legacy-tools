    we sometimes receive emails requesting access to the individual tools and pages

- bolt

    https://legacy.glamour.de/bolt
    Data format: json
    we maintained 27 bolts
    we maintained 40 bolt extensions
    the most important extension was the "design extension"
        contains the base templates for all bolts
        works with overrides and inheritance; to be flexible and prevent redundant code
        bolt contains only options and overrides that are required for the specific needs of the use cases of the individual bolt was made for
    the last extension was the "flyway extension"
        to translate our json data from Bolt into the markdown format of CoPilot/verso.
        And to map our fields (like "title" or "kicker") to CoPilot fields (like "hed" or "dek")

- kraken
    https://kraken.condenastdigital.de/dashboard
    Content Syndication with external services
    as our data pool where stored in different CMS like eZ publish, WordPress, bolt, tumblr and last but not least CoPilot we decided to create at tool to equalize all our data
    the tools was called kraken and imports and converts all our data from whatever to json

- nautilus
    https://nautilus.condenastdigital.de/dashboard
    nautilus is quite the opposite to kraken. I know both are Mollusks but they worked very different...
    while kraken consolidates data, nautilus spreads data.
    nautilus is able to convert our json format to whatever and provide the data in feed form
    we had feeds for msn, Google News, Glamour App, Focus Online, Facebook Instant Articles and of course RSS

- patrick
    https://competitions.condenastdigital.de/dashboard
    as we started to work with SailThru as our Newsletter provider we realized that SailThru forms are not usable for us
    so we started to create a form creator for newsletter subscription and competition pages
    we called it patrick like Patrick Star from Sponge Bob

- harpoon

    redirects are allways pain in the ass
    when I started at CondeNast eight years ago I found thousands of redirects
    - for migration issues
    - but also for editorial issues such as
        "oh, sorry we already printet this URL in our magazine. we didn't know the page has a quite different URL"
    so we built our own redirector and linkshortener that could be used by editiors as well as out product and project people
